\section{Business Plan}

This project is intended for Moldavian Government and it's citizens, but the main goal is to facilitate and speed up development process of Governmental sites.

\subsection{Schedule}

In this section we will describe the schedule for the project to get finished in time. Schedule will be composed of following steps: determination of objectives, determination of the amount of work and tasks division, implementations of task. 

\subsubsection{Objectives}

The main goal of every company is to earn a profit by selling products or services that it provides. Similarly, the developers aim to have a substantial profit from their invested efforts in creating and launching the system.  The main economic goal was to create a system that would collect fees from its users, and to satisfy all needs and expectations from the project. 

\subsubsection{SWOT Analysis}
Performing the SWOT analysis over a system gives a brief overview about expectations or possible problems that can appear during the lifetime of the system.It is mandatory to identify the SWOTs because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the expected objectives. In Table \ref{table:swot}  it is represented the strategic planning method, used to evaluate Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threads that can involve the given system.

\begin{minipage}{3.1in}

\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:swot}
\end{table}

Referring to the SWOT analysis as the basis of the promotion/development of any product, each company has the opportunity to foresee the possible profit as well as possible wastage. One of the most dangerous factors that can be prevented with SWOT is the risk of concurrency, which also has an important role in market development and the increase of product's quality. To predict other negative effects, any company must have a well-designed plan, like having monthly statistics, which would contribute at diminishing economical threats.

\subsubsection{The time meant for the accomplishment of the project and the schedule}

To schedule the working plan, first of all it is necessary study all information necessary for its implementation, realization and then to divide the whole process of implementation in small steps, called activities, which will be evaluated individually. Only in such a way can be scheduled the more correct plan, which would lead to the in-time accomplishment of the project. 

The duration of the project’s execution can be represented in the Formula 4.1 below:

\begin{equation}
Duration = startdate - finish date + reserve time(days)
\end{equation}

where: start date, finish date– indicate the days in which activities take place;  time reserve – the number of extra-schedule days the developer has.

 According to the schedule presented in the Table 4.2 expected time of development is 93 days. 

 \subsection{Economical Proofs}

  In economy in actual to bring economic proofs for the IT projects, based on the specific of the concurrencies in economic relationships, which suppose a wide research space. In the conditions of a low degree of determination of the marketing environment, of high prices’ volatility, decreased degree of prognoses depth, a common business-plan doesn’t allow the exact foreseeing of the final results of the business. In this context, one of the basic instruments is choosing the methods, the right positions and indices for the economical proofs. 


  \subsubsection{Material and non-material expenses}

  For any specific project it is necessary to do the calculations that need the prognosis of the necessary amount of money for the expenses. Direct materials cost is the cost of direct materials which can be easily identified with the unit of production.  The manufacture of products or goods required material as the prime element. In general, these materials are divided into two categories. These categories are direct materials and indirect materials. In table 4.3 and 4.4 below are presented the material and non-material expenses that arise during its development.

Social and medical insurance funds express the amount of money added to the total pay off. Social fund represents additional 23\% . Medical insurance rate is approved every year by “Compulsory medical insurance fund” law. Therefore, rate for 2014 is 4\%. The amount of expenses on work remuneration was calculated using Formula 5.2:

\begin{equation}
	TR=TP+SF+MA=19815+4557.45+792=25165.05
\end{equation}

 where: TR is total remuneration, TP is total pay off, SF is social fund expenses and MA is medical assurance. After calculations we obtain TR equal with 25165.05 (MDL).

\subsubsection{Indirect expenses}

The fixed means pay of is the partial loss of the consumable properties and value of the means during their usage, influenced by different factors and the increase of the work productivity. The importance of indirect costs is the calculation of depreciation and amortization. For accounting purposes, depreciation should be calculated evenly throughout the project activity.  Besides the expenses for the printer, PC, etc, there must be included the expenses for electricity, internet. These expenses are also related to the project, because they are extremely necessary in its development. We take into account the working hours at PC 8 hours per day.  The energy expenses are due to the PC usage and the illumination of the workplace during the project development. The number of hours the PC worked raises to \[744h (93 days * 8 h)\].

We’ll take into account that PC use \[400W/h\]. \[ Total power usage = (400 * 744)/1000= 297 kW + 200 kW (used electricity) = 497kW\]. The calculation of the indirect consumption for the utilities is presented in the Table 4.7.
